# Battleship

The classic, grid-based game of naval warfare.

Each player starts with an empty 10x10 grid. Rows are identified with the letters A-J, columns by the numbers 1-10. Each player places all of their ships on their grid. They then take turns firing at positions on the grid until either _all_ of their opponent's ships are sunk or their own ships are all sunk.

## This project

Instead of a two-player version of the game this project is instead to implement a single player CLI version that accepts input files and produces the expected output as described below.
